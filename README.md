# Solutions of Assignments

**It is a collection of solutions for assignments in the course delivered by KTH, ID2209 Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents.**

1. The assignment 1 is an introduction to GAMA platform using a programming language GAML. About the details of the language, here is a hyperlink about [it](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Tutorials). The main task is to build a festival for agents, who have different behaviors and attributes.

2. The assignment 2 is mainly about Agent Negotiation and Agent Communication, where communication protocol - [FIPA](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/UsingFIPAACL) should be used. The task is to create a series of distinct auctions to simulate negotiation between auctioneers and bidders.

3. The assignment 3 is about Agent Coordination. In task 1, a N Queen Problem should be solved. And in task 2 and the challenge, further attributes are assined to the guests. They can choose different stages according to their preferences to maximize their individual utility. In the challenge, a new agent is added - Leader, whose duty is to coordinate agents behaviors tending to gain maximized global utility.

4. The final project consists of different places to let events happen. The events are conducted by different types of agents, who will react with each other under certain conditions. In this task, a control system [BDI](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/BDIAgents) should be used. 
As for the super challenge is to conduct a Reinforcement Learning network to solve the problem. But there are no APIs in GAMA such as backpropagation even gradient decent. So it costs a lot to achieve this, then this solution is not included in the project.
